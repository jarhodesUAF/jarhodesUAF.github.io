<p id="title">Calculus at UAF</p>
<hr class="line" />
<p>The UAF Calculus sequence of MATH 251, 252, 253 primarily serves engineering, natural science and mathematics majors. Our curriculum  follows national norms for student training  and reflects discussions with UAF faculty in these fields. The sequence will give students a solid preparation for more advanced studies in their chosen major.</p>
<p>In addition to science and engineering students, we welcome students who are simply interested in obtaining a thorough understanding one of the key intellectual developments that underlies our modern technological world. However, we also offer MATH 230: Essential Calculus with Applications, a one-semester course which focuses on the most important topics for students ofÂ business, economics and the life sciences.</p>
<p>Courses in the Calculus sequence build strongly on their predecessors, and must be taken in order. It is  best to continue the sequence in consecutive semesters, since breaks between courses  create an extra burden in getting back up to speed on earlier material.</p>
<p>Entry into MATH 251 is by placement exam or successful completion of either MATH 156 or MATH 151 and 152 . Students with AP or CLEP credit for predecessor courses may begin in MATH 252 or 253.</p>
<p>For questions, please contact the Department of Mathematics and Statistics by email at <a href="mailto:UAF-MathAndStat-Dept@alaska.edu">UAF-MathAndStat-Dept@alaska.edu</a>, or phone at 907-474-7332.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Textbooks:</p>
<p> In Fall 2021, we will begin transitioning to a new textbook series from <a href="<a href="https://openstax.org" target="_blank">OpenStax</a>. These can be downloaded as free pdfs, or ordered in print through the links:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1" target="_blank">Calculus I</a>, starting Fall 2021</p>
	<p> <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2" target="_blank">Calculus II</a>, starting Spring 2022</p>
	<p> <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-3" target="_blank">Calculus III</a>, starting Fall 2022</p>
</blockquote>
<p> These are well-written books, based on contributions from faculty around the country, and will help keep student expenses down. Use of an on-line homework system will
involve a student charge, but will be considerably more affordable than those of mainstream commercial textbook publishers that we've used in the past.</p>

<p>As the next texts roll into use, the information on topic coverage below will be updated, but content change will be minimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="subtitle">MATH F251X: Calculus I</p>
<p>This course introduces the fundamental mathematical concepts used to describe change, as well as their basic applications. The <em>derivative</em> can be described physically as  a rate of change, or geometrically as a slope on a curve. The <em>integral</em> physically represents  total accumulated change, or geometrically the area under a curve. Applications include the relationships between position, velocity, and acceleration; optimization; and approximation.</p>
<p>While sections of Math 251 are typically taught by several different instructors, they are tightly coordinated with a common syllabus, schedule, and examinations. For the current semester, these materials and many other resources (homework assignments, past quizzes and exams, etc.) can be found at:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subtitle">MATH F252X: Calculus II</p>
<p>Building on its predecessor, this course has three distinct parts: 1) developing further methods for computating integrals, 2) developing and exploring applications of integration in the sciences and engineering; and 3) the new topic of infinite <em>series</em>, in which functions are represented by sums with infinitely many terms. </p>

<p class="subtitle">MATH F253X: Calculus III</p>
<p>Calculus III takes the basic concepts of calculus from earlier courses and moves them into the 3-dimensional world. It provides the framework for analyzing motions of objects through space, changes in quantities (such as temperature) that vary throughout space, and velocity and force fields (such as a gravitational field) that not only vary through space but act on objects in specific directions. The mathematical concept of a <em>vector</em> plays a key role throughout.</p>
